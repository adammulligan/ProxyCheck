# ProxyCheck

## What it is

A Google Chrome extension that checks to see if your external IP is that of the desired proxy -- such as a personal vps, vpn, random proxy server, etc. -- and alerts you at the beginning of sessions if you are not behind the proxy.

## Random requirements

* Maintain a list of possible proxy addresses
* Wildcarding for large subnets, like university VPNs etc
* Manage alerts
* Set on/off periods
* Icon colour dependent on whether behind proxy or not
